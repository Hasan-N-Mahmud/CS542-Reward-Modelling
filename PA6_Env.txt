PA6 environment and dependencies

On a department remote machine Python 3.9 is system-provided.
If you create a new environment on the remote machine, it is best to unalias python and unset PYTHONPATH first.
Then 
Create your environment:
python3.9 -m venv yourenv
Activate yourenv:
source yourenv/bin/activate

These versions work:
torch = 2.8.0+cu128
transformers = 4.57.1
accelerate = 1.10.1
peft = 0.17.1
datasets = 4.4.1
sentence-transformers = 5.1.2

To make sure dependencies install in your env, when you want to install in your env, always do ./yourenv/bin/python -m pip install… 
For example:
./yourenv/bin/python -m pip install torch>=2.0.0
./yourenv/bin/python -m pip install transformers accelerate datasets
./yourenv/bin/python -m pip install sentence-transformers


Run the script:
./yourenv/bin/python yourscript.py
